              <span class="info">Summary:</span>
              <p>Jason was Batman's second Robin. Originally, his backstory was
                  nearly identical to Dick Graysons. But after the <em>Crisis on
                  Infinite Earths</em> event, his backstory was re-worked
                  significantly. He went from being from the circus to being a
                  poor kid living on the streets of Gotham. His initial run-in with
                  Batman involved successfully stealing 3 out of 4 tires on the Batmobile.
              </p>
            <p>However, Jason was angrier and more reckless than Dick, and he had
                his fair share of detractors. In 1988, DC famously ran the <em>Death in
                the Family</em> event, where readers were allowed to vote on if Jason
                survived. It's rumored that one caller spammed the voting phone line, tipping
                the vote towards his death.
            </p>
            <p>In the mid-2000s, Judd Winnick decided to revive the character, using a recent
                event to justify how Jason could suddenly be alive. He then wrote the <em>Under
                the Red Hood</em> and <em>Lost Days</em> stories to much acclaim, and Jason was
                remade as the Red Hood.
