              <span class="info">Summary:</span>
              <p>Tim Drake was Batman's third Robin. Where Jason was violent And
                  reckless, Tim was cautious and smart. He is known as the most
                  technologically capable Robin. A techno-wizard, if you will. He
                  is also extremely smart.
              </p>
            <p>Tim was introduced after Jason Todd's death. In his backstory, he
                managed to figure out the secret identities of both Batman and Nightwing.
                He also noticed that Batman was spiraling after Jason's death, and needed
                Robin. At the end of this arc, Tim was chosen to be the new Robin.
            </p>
            <p>Compared to the other Robins, Tim lacked a traumatic background. And he
                even managed to have the most stable romantic relationship in the comics.
                Tim is dating Steph Brown (who was a Robin herself until the launch of the
                New 52 universe) and Connor Kent's punching through reality to save him was
                used as the basis for Jason's eventual revival
